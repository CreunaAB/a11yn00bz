		<p>Every Mac has a tool built in called VoiceOver. Here is how you find and use it.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Open up System Preferences and look for the Universal Access symbol. Hit it!</p>
				<!-- not satisfied with screenshots. Will add all images once text is finished.
				<img src="img/mac-pref.jpg" alt="Preferences on Mac showing Universial Access on the first row" />-->
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>At the top on the tab seeing you'll see VoiceOver. You can turn it on from here or use the shortcut âŒ˜fn F5.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Turned it on? Good! Now open up a web browser. Safari is good. </p>
				<p>
					Yes I know. You are hearing an annoying voice. You'll get used to it.
					You might adjust the voice etc. using the VoiceOver Utility that can be found in the System Prefernces. This is supplementary. Please dig deeper later. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Moving on. Now go to a web site that you would like to test.</p>
			</li>
